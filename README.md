## üöÄ Quick Start

- Make sure you have following installed before we continue:
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    
- Then clone this repository and install its dependencies.
Run the following commands in your terminal or Git bash cmd:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/vishal-patel17/LicenseApp.git
  cd LicenseApp
  npm install
```
- Once installed, run [Hardhat's](https://hardhat.org/) testing network. This will also give you a list of addresses for testing
```bash
  npx hardhat node
```
- Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this command to <b>deploy</b> your contract to the localhost network. This will also <b>compile</b> your Smart Contract:
```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
- Add a custom [RPC network](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC) in your Metamask wallet for testing with the following configuration:

  - Network name: <b>TR Test Network</b>
  - New RPC URL: <b>http://127.0.0.1:8545/</b>
  - Chain ID: <b>1337</b>
  - Currency Symbol: <b>TRT</b>

- Save the above configuration and finally, run the frontend with:
```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm start
```



## ‚öôÔ∏è Troubleshooting

- ```Invalid nonce``` errors: if you are seeing this error on the ```npx hardhat node``` console, try <b>resetting</b> your Metamask account. This will reset the account's transaction history and also the nonce. Open Metamask, click on your account followed by ```Settings > Advanced > Reset Account```.
